# TorchSim Documentation

TorchSim is a PyTorch-based molecular dynamics simulation framework that integrates traditional molecular force fields with machine learning potential models.

## Features

- **GPU Acceleration**: Leverages PyTorch's CUDA support for high-performance simulations
- **Hybrid Force Fields**: Combines Lennard-Jones potential with machine learning potentials
- **Flexible Integrators**: Verlet algorithm with NVT ensemble support
- **GNN Support**: Integrated with PyTorch Geometric for graph neural networks
- **Easy to Extend**: Modular design allows for easy addition of new force fields and integrators
